# Environment Setup

## 1 - Prepare your Microsoft 365 tenant

**Need a development environment?**

If you don't currently have an Microsoft 365 work/school account, you can sign up for a **[Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/m365developers)** subscription. It's free for 90 days and will continually renew as long as you're using it for development activity. If you have a Visual Studio Enterprise or Professional subscription, both programs include a free Microsoft 365 developer subscription, active for the life of your Visual Studio subscription. See Set up a Microsoft 365 developer subscription.

**Already have a Microsoft 365 account?**

If you are a Microsoft 365 subscriber, you can develop apps with Microsoft Graph by using one of the following [plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ww/microsoft-365/enterprise/compare-office-365-plans?rtc=1):

* Business Essentials
* Business Premium
* Enterprise E1, E3, and E5
* Developer
* Education, Education Plus, and Education E5
* Microsoft Teams will also be available to customers who subscribed to E4 prior to its retirement.

## 4 - Setup your GitHub account

GitHub offers personal accounts for individuals and organizations for teams of people working together.

You can create a personal account, which serves as your identity on <https://github.com>, or an organization, which allows multiple personal accounts to collaborate across multiple projects.

For more information, see [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account#about-new-accounts-on-githubcom).
